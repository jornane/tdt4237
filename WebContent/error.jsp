                    You have no idea how hard it is. Everyone just comes to me, asking for a page or giving me some command.<br />
                    And I just have to do it and they leave rightaway. Nobody stays for some coffee of a nice chat.<br />
                    I'm so lonely... I do the best I can, I swear!<br />
                    But this time I just couldn't perform, i'm so sorry!<br />
                    Please don't be mad at me, I tried my best, really.<br />
                    Don't be mad please, don't yell at me.<br />
                    It's probably your fault anyway.<br />
                    You're playing some kind of prank on me.<br />
                    Trying to expose all the data i'm trying to protect.<br />
                    Or insert some kind of malicious code.<br />
                    Bwah, not cool man! Not cool.<br />
                    Let's see how you like it. Doing your job and everything.<br />
                    And then someone like you comes along, and tries to mess up all your work.<br />
                    Now go away, you make me sick.
